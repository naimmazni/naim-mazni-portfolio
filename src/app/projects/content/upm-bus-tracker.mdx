## Overview

UPM Bus Tracker is a comprehensive real-time bus tracking system designed specifically for Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) campus. The application helps students and staff track campus shuttle buses in real-time, making campus transportation more efficient and predictable.

## The Challenge

Students at UPM often faced uncertainty about bus schedules and locations, leading to:

- Long waiting times at bus stops
- Missed classes due to unpredictable bus arrivals
- Frustration with the lack of real-time information
- Inefficient campus transportation planning

## The Solution

I developed a full-stack web application using Laravel and PHP that provides:

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Bus Tracking**: Live GPS tracking of all campus shuttle buses
- **Route Management**: Complete visualization of bus routes across campus
- **Schedule Display**: Up-to-date timetables for all bus services
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive design for quick access to information
- **Mobile Responsive**: Accessible on any device, anywhere on campus

### Technical Implementation

**Backend:**

- Laravel framework for robust server-side logic
- PHP for efficient data processing
- MySQL database for storing route and schedule data
- RESTful API architecture for real-time updates

**Frontend:**

- Responsive web interface
- Real-time map integration
- Dynamic schedule updates
- Mobile-first design approach

## Impact

The UPM Bus Tracker has significantly improved campus transportation efficiency:

- Students can plan their journeys more effectively
- Reduced waiting times at bus stops
- Better overall campus mobility
- Serves the entire UPM student community

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel** - PHP web framework
- **PHP** - Server-side scripting
- **MySQL** - Database management
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Frontend development
- **Git** - Version control

## What I Learned

This project taught me valuable lessons in:

- Building scalable real-time tracking systems
- Laravel framework architecture and best practices
- Database design for location-based services
- Creating practical solutions for real-world problems
- User-centered design for campus communities

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the system:

- Push notifications for bus arrivals
- ETA predictions using machine learning
- User feedback system
- Integration with UPM student portal
- Multi-language support (English/Malay)
