## Overview

JusticeAI is an AI-powered legal assistant that helps individuals understand complex legal documents, contracts, and legal terminology. Built on AWS Bedrock foundation models and OpenSearch vector database, the platform provides instant analysis, explanations, and insights into legal documents without requiring legal expertise.

## Problem

Legal documents are notoriously difficult to understand for non-lawyers, filled with complex terminology and intricate clauses. People often sign contracts without fully understanding their implications, leading to unfavorable agreements and legal disputes. Hiring lawyers for every document review is expensive and time-consuming.

## Solution

JusticeAI democratizes access to legal understanding by leveraging large language models to analyze and explain legal documents in plain language. Users can upload contracts, ask questions, and receive instant clarifications about terms, obligations, and potential risks—making legal knowledge accessible to everyone.

## Key Features

- **Document Analysis**: Upload and analyze any legal document instantly
- **Plain Language Explanations**: Complex legal terms translated to simple language
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential unfavorable clauses and red flags
- **Q&A Interface**: Ask specific questions about document contents
- **Clause Comparison**: Compare terms across multiple documents
- **Summary Generation**: Get executive summaries of lengthy contracts
- **Citation Verification**: Cross-reference legal precedents and statutes

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Bedrock**: Foundation models for natural language understanding
- **AWS OpenSearch**: Vector database for semantic search and document retrieval
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing for scalable processing
- **Python**: Backend development and AI model integration

## Architecture

The system leverages AWS's AI/ML stack:

- **Document Processing**: PDF parsing and text extraction
- **Embedding Generation**: Convert documents to vector embeddings
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant clauses using OpenSearch
- **LLM Processing**: Generate explanations using Bedrock models
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation history for follow-up questions

## Technical Implementation
