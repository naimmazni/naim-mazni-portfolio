## Overview

ChiliCare is an intelligent IoT solution designed for chili farmers, combining automated pest detection with smart irrigation management. Using ESP32-CAM modules and computer vision, the system monitors crops 24/7, detects pest infestations early, and optimizes water usage through intelligent irrigation control.

## Problem

Chili farmers face significant crop losses due to pest infestations that go undetected until severe damage occurs. Additionally, inefficient watering practices lead to water waste and inconsistent crop quality. Manual monitoring is labor-intensive and often misses early warning signs.

## Solution

ChiliCare deploys ESP32-CAM modules throughout the farm to continuously monitor crops. The system uses computer vision to detect pests in real-time and automatically adjusts irrigation based on soil moisture levels and weather conditions. Farmers receive instant alerts and can monitor their entire farm remotely.

## Key Features

- **Automated Pest Detection**: Real-time pest identification using computer vision
- **Smart Irrigation**: Automated watering based on soil moisture and weather data
- **Remote Monitoring**: Mobile app for farm surveillance from anywhere
- **Early Warning System**: Instant alerts for pest detection and irrigation issues
- **Water Optimization**: Reduce water usage by 40% through intelligent scheduling
- **Data Analytics**: Historical data and insights for better farming decisions
- **Low Power Design**: Solar-powered ESP32 modules for sustainable operation

## Technologies Used

- **ESP32-CAM**: IoT camera module for image capture and edge processing
- **Python**: Backend processing and ML model training
- **TensorFlow Lite**: On-device pest detection with optimized models
- **Node.js**: Real-time data processing and API services

## System Architecture

The system consists of:

- **Field Sensors**: ESP32-CAM modules with soil moisture sensors
- **Edge Processing**: TensorFlow Lite models running on ESP32
- **Cloud Backend**: Node.js server for data aggregation and analytics
- **Mobile App**: React Native app for farmer interface
- **Irrigation Control**: Automated valve system controlled via IoT

## Technical Highlights

- Trained custom ML model to detect 15+ common chili pests
- Achieved 92% accuracy in pest identification
- Designed low-power system with 30+ days battery life
- Implemented mesh network for reliable farm-wide connectivity
- Built real-time alert system with SMS and push notifications

## Impact

ChiliCare helps farmers detect pest problems 3-5 days earlier than manual inspection, reducing crop losses by 35%. The smart irrigation system cuts water usage by 40% while improving crop yield by 25% through optimal watering schedules.

## Development Challenges

- Optimizing ML models to run on resource-constrained ESP32
- Ensuring reliable connectivity across large farm areas
- Balancing power consumption with monitoring frequency
- Adapting to varying lighting conditions for accurate pest detection

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with drone surveillance for larger farms
